description: 'The class project will consist of a three-stage process: inventory and
  analysis, detailed research in priority areas, and formulation of a final plan.
  This three-stage process will occur within an overall environment of reflective
  practice. The reflective framework for the practicum will center around two issues.
  First is the issue of identity construction

  through design and the way that a design process is tied as much to the designer''s
  own identity construction as to the community''s. Second is the issue of interaction
  with the community and what it means to incorporate community knowledge into a planning
  process. Students will keep a journal of their experiences in the class and will
  respond to assigned reflective exercises in this book.'
